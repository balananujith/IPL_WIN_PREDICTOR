# IPL Win Predictor

Welcome to the IPL Win Predictor project! This application predicts the probability of winning for the batting and bowling teams in an IPL match based on various factors such as target score, current score, overs completed, wickets lost, and more.

## How it Works

The predictor utilizes a machine learning model trained on IPL match data to make predictions. It takes inputs such as batting team, bowling team, host city, target score, current score, overs completed, and wickets lost to calculate the probabilities of each team winning the match.
